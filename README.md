# 📋 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📝 Introduction  
This repository is dedicated to documenting the **Requirement Analysis phase** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for a **Booking Management System**.  

The goal is to simulate a real-world project planning scenario by identifying, organising, and analysing system requirements. This structured approach ensures a clear roadmap for successful development and delivery.

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and clearly defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. This process sets the foundation for all subsequent stages of development, ensuring that the final product aligns with user goals and business objectives.

### 🎯 Importance in SDLC

- **Clarity and Direction**: Helps teams understand *what* needs to be built before *how* to build it.
- **Improves Communication**: Acts as a bridge between stakeholders, developers, designers, and testers.
- **Reduces Rework**: By clarifying expectations early, it minimises costly changes and misunderstandings later.
- **Supports Planning**: Provides input for estimating timelines, budgeting, and resource allocation.
- **Ensures Quality**: Establishes measurable acceptance criteria that guide testing and validation.

## ❓ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the success of any software project. It provides a clear foundation for the entire development process and ensures alignment between the technical team and stakeholders.

### 🔑 Key Reasons

1. **Guides the Development Process**  
   Clearly defined requirements act as a roadmap for developers, reducing ambiguity and helping ensure the product meets expectations.

2. **Saves Time and Costs**  
   Identifying requirements early helps avoid unnecessary rework and scope creep, keeping the project within budget and on schedule.

3. **Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction**  
   Involving users and stakeholders during requirement gathering guarantees the final solution addresses real needs, increasing satisfaction and usability.
